EDGE CASES:
  - PERMISSIONS ON FILES/DIRS

CURRENT PROGRAM LIMITATIONS :
  - BOTH MAIN AND REPLICA FOLDER DIRECTORIES MUST EXIST (CREATED BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPT).
  - LOG FILE NEEDS TO ALREADY HAVE BEEN CREATED (CREATED BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPT).
  - ALL PATHS GIVEN TO COMMAND LINE MUST BE ABSOLUTE PATHS (IS THIS PLATFORM DEPENDENT?).
  - INTERVAL TIME NEEDS TO BE IN SECONDS AND A INTEGER.
  - LETS SAY BETWEEN INTERVALS YOU STARTING COPYING A BIG DIR TO THE SOURCE THE SCRIPT WILL LOG DIR COPIED AND THEN ADD FILES AS THEY ARE BEING ADDED ASWELL(DOES NOT WAIT FOR COPY TO SOURCE TO BE FINISHED)
